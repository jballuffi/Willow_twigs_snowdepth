## Summary of starting biomass and compositions

Transect data on average found starting willow biomass to increase with height class with average availabilities being `r biomass[height == "low", round(mean(Biomass), 1)]`, `r biomass[height == "medium", round(mean(Biomass), 1)]`, and `r biomass[height == "high", round(mean(Biomass), 1)]` g for the low, medium, and high heights, respectively.
